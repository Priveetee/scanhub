# **Project Introduction**

This project was born out of a simple problem: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). The question I asked myself was:

How can we simplify the lives of developers who need to analyze CVEs, given the multitude of tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses? Currently, developers have to search high and low, combine everything, and often end up demotivated, making slow progress.

# **Project Objectives**

To address this issue, I set out with two main objectives:

* Provide a simple and intuitive frontend
* Offer an extremely comprehensive and robust backend

# **Technology Choices**

For the frontend, I initially chose Remix, an excellent framework. However, as development progressed, the complexity of the page increased, errors became more frequent, etc. I decided to switch technologies and chose Svelte Kit + Bun, two technologies I wasn't necessarily familiar with but found to be very efficient, logical, clean, and well-documented.

For the backend, I sought a technology that was stable, well-structured, and container-friendly. Go was an obvious choice for me, as it is a stable, scalable, and compiled language, ensuring stability and efficiency.
