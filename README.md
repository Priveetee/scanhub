# CVE Scanner

A simple, intuitive tool to analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for developers.

## Project Introduction

This project was born out of a simple problem: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). The question I asked myself was:

How can we simplify the lives of developers who need to analyze CVEs, given the multitude of tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses? Currently, developers have to search high and low, combine everything, and often end up demotivated, making slow progress.

## Project Objectives

To address this issue, I set out with two main objectives:

* Provide a simple and intuitive frontend
* Offer an extremely comprehensive and robust backend

## Technology Choices

For the frontend, I initially chose Remix, an excellent framework. However, as development progressed, the complexity of the page increased, errors became more frequent, etc. I decided to switch technologies and chose Svelte Kit + Bun, two technologies I wasn't necessarily familiar with but found to be very efficient, logical, clean, and well-documented.

For the backend, I sought a technology that was stable, well-structured, and container-friendly. Go was an obvious choice for me, as it is a stable, scalable, and compiled language, ensuring stability and efficiency.

## Features

- Simple interface for searching and analyzing CVEs
- Visual summaries of vulnerability data
- Filtering capabilities by severity, date, and affected packages
- Responsive design that works on all devices

## Getting Started

Getting started is extremely simple:

1. Install Bun: https://bun.sh/
2. Navigate to the root of the project
3. Run `bun install` to install dependencies
4. Run `bun run dev` to start the development server

That's it, you're all set!

## Documentation

I strongly encourage you to explore the documentation for both technologies as they are very comprehensive:
- Svelte Kit: https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction
- Bun: https://bun.sh/docs

## Contributing

This project is completely open-source and free. You are welcome to modify and redistribute it as you wish. Feel free to create issues or contribute to the project.

## Project Status

The project is currently in active development, and I am doing my best to maintain it and add new features. I am thrilled to share this project with you and hope you will enjoy it!
